# Google OAuth Configuration (same as your existing google-sheets-update function)
# You need to set these environment variables in your Supabase project
# Go to: Project Settings > API > Environment Variables

# Google OAuth Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_google_refresh_token_here

# Note: The spreadsheet ID and sheet name are hardcoded in the function
# to match your existing google-sheets-update function:
# SPREADSHEET_ID = "1nd1kxEj_Vwh7WIoGWcbZ1nm425irkQmvcLiuL9-4XDY"
# SHEET_NAME = "AgentPortalSheetTesting"

# Instructions:
# 1. Use the same OAuth credentials as your existing google-sheets-update function
# 2. These should already be configured in your Supabase environment variables
# 3. The function uses the same spreadsheet and sheet as your existing setup
# 4. No additional configuration needed if google-sheets-update is working
