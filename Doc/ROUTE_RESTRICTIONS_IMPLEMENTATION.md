# Route-Level Security Implementation

## Summary
Enhanced the existing security system to implement **route-level restrictions** for user ID: `adda1255-2a0b-41da-9df0-3100d01b8649`. The restricted user can now **ONLY** access the `/daily-deal-flow` route and will be automatically redirected from any other page.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ProtectedRoute Component (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- Added route-level restriction logic
- Automatically redirects restricted users to `/daily-deal-flow` from any other route
- Uses `useLocation` to monitor current path
- Replaces history entry (no back button to restricted page)

### 2. Updated Index Page (`src/pages/Index.tsx`)
- Modified initial login redirect logic
- **Restricted users** → redirect to `/daily-deal-flow`
- **Normal users** → redirect to `/dashboard`

### 3. Updated Dashboard Page (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)  
- Added proactive restriction check
- Automatically redirects restricted users away from dashboard
- Prevents any access to dashboard functionality

### 4. Fixed DataGrid Actions Column (`src/pages/DailyDealFlow/components/DataGrid.tsx`)
- Corrected import statement corruption
- Actions column dynamically added only for users with write permissions
- Clean table header without Actions for restricted users

### 5. Created RestrictedRoute Component (`src/components/RestrictedRoute.tsx`)
- Alternative component for fine-grained route control (not actively used but available)
- Configurable allowed routes
- Reusable for future restrictions

## Security Flow

### **For Restricted User (ID: `adda1255-2a0b-41da-9df0-3100d01b8649`)**

1. **Login/Index** → Automatically redirected to `/daily-deal-flow`
2. **Any attempt to access other routes** → Automatically redirected to `/daily-deal-flow`
3. **Dashboard access** → Blocked and redirected
4. **Navigation menu** → Completely hidden (from previous implementation)
5. **Direct URL access** → Blocked by ProtectedRoute

### **Route Access Matrix**
```
Route                    | Restricted User | Normal Users
-------------------------|-----------------|-------------
/                       | ➜ /daily-deal-flow | ➜ /dashboard  
/auth                   | ✅ Allowed      | ✅ Allowed
/dashboard              | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
/daily-deal-flow        | ✅ Allowed      | ✅ Allowed
/transfer-portal        | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
/submission-portal      | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
/reports                | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
/analytics              | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
/bulk-lookup            | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
/call-result-update     | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
/new-callback           | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
/call-result-journey    | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
/* (any other)          | ❌ Redirected   | ✅ Allowed
```

## Implementation Features

✅ **Automatic Redirection**: No manual intervention needed - all redirects are automatic
✅ **History Replacement**: Uses `replace: true` to prevent back-button access
✅ **Clean UI**: No visible disabled buttons or broken navigation
✅ **Future-Proof**: Easy to modify allowed routes or add more restricted users
✅ **Performance**: Minimal overhead - only checks on route changes

## Testing the Restrictions

1. **Login as restricted user** (`adda1255-2a0b-41da-9df0-3100d01b8649`)
2. **Verify automatic redirect** to `/daily-deal-flow`
3. **Try accessing `/dashboard`** directly in URL → should redirect
4. **Try accessing any other route** → should redirect to `/daily-deal-flow`
5. **Verify no navigation menu** is visible
6. **Verify no action buttons** in the data grid
7. **Verify only read-only access** to data

## Technical Notes

- **Route monitoring**: Uses React Router's `useLocation` hook
- **Redirect timing**: Only after authentication is complete (`!loading`)
- **Graceful fallback**: If somehow accessed, user sees loading state then gets redirected
- **No infinite loops**: Careful logic prevents redirect loops
- **Clean URLs**: Uses `replace: true` for clean browser history

The restricted user is now completely locked to the `/daily-deal-flow` route with read-only access, exactly as requested!
