# Callback Request Feature - BPO-Client Connection

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive callback request system that allows BPO centers to request callbacks from agents for their leads with three specific request types.

## Feature Components

### 1. Database Schema
**Table**: `callback_requests`

**Columns**:
- `id` (UUID) - Primary key
- `submission_id` (TEXT) - Lead submission ID
- `lead_vendor` (TEXT) - BPO center name
- `request_type` (TEXT) - Type of callback request (constrained)
- `notes` (TEXT) - Detailed notes about the request
- `customer_name` (TEXT) - Client name
- `phone_number` (TEXT) - Client phone
- `status` (TEXT) - Request status (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- `requested_by` (UUID) - User who created the request
- `requested_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - When request was created
- `completed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - When request was completed
- `completed_by` (UUID) - Agent who completed it
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

**Request Types**:
1. `new_application` - New Application
2. `updating_billing` - Updating Billing/Draft Date
3. `carrier_requirements` - Fulfilling Pending Carrier Requirements

**Indexes**:
- submission_id (for lead lookup)
- lead_vendor (for BPO filtering)
- status (for pending/completed filtering)
- requested_at DESC (for chronological listing)

**RLS Policies**:
- Center users can INSERT their own requests
- Center users can SELECT their own requests
- Agents can SELECT all requests
- Agents can UPDATE all requests

### 2. Frontend Components

#### CallbackRequestForm Component
**Location**: `src/components/CallbackRequestForm.tsx`

**Features**:
- Two-panel layout using Dialog
- **Left Panel**: Complete lead information display
  - Submission ID
  - Customer Name
  - Phone Number
  - State
  - Carrier
  - Coverage Amount
  - Monthly Premium
  - Created Date
  - Submission Date
  - Lead Vendor
  
- **Right Panel**: Callback request form
  - Request Type dropdown (3 options)
  - Notes textarea (required)
  - Submit/Cancel buttons
  - Loading state with spinner

**Props**:
```typescript
interface CallbackRequestFormProps {
  lead: Lead;
  leadVendor: string;
  open: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onSuccess?: () => void;
}
```

**Validation**:
- Request type must be selected
- Notes cannot be empty
- All fields are required before submission

#### CenterLeadPortal Updates
**Location**: `src/pages/CenterLeadPortal.tsx`

**New Features**:
- "Send Callback" button on each lead card
- Opens CallbackRequestForm dialog
- Refreshes leads after successful submission
- Uses Send icon from lucide-react

**Button Styling**:
- Blue primary button (`bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700`)
- Positioned in bottom-right of lead card
- Send icon with label

### 3. Integration Flow

```
1. BPO User clicks "Send Callback" on a lead
   ↓
2. CallbackRequestForm opens with lead details
   ↓
3. User selects request type and adds notes
   ↓
4. On submit:
   - Saves to callback_requests table
   - Sends Slack notification
   - Closes dialog
   - Refreshes lead list
   ↓
5. Slack notification sent to public channel
```

### 4. Slack Notification

**Function**: `send-slack-notification`

**Payload Structure**:
```typescript
{
  type: 'callback_request',
  data: {
    submission_id: string,
    customer_name: string,
    phone_number: string,
    lead_vendor: string,
    request_type: string, // Human-readable label
    notes: string,
    carrier: string,
    coverage_amount: number,
    monthly_premium: number,
    state: string,
    requested_at: ISO timestamp
  }
}
```

**Slack Message Content**:
- Shows request type prominently
- Includes all lead details
- Shows notes from BPO
- Timestamp of request
- Can be configured to post to specific channel

### 5. Request Types Explained

#### 1. New Application
**Use Case**: BPO needs agent to process a brand new insurance application
- Client is ready to apply
- All information has been gathered
- Needs agent to take over and submit

#### 2. Updating Billing/Draft Date
**Use Case**: Existing application needs billing information or draft date updated
- Client changed banking information
- Draft date needs to be rescheduled
- Payment method needs updating

#### 3. Fulfilling Pending Carrier Requirements
**Use Case**: Carrier requested additional information or documentation
- Medical exams needed
- Additional forms required
- Carrier-specific requirements to complete
