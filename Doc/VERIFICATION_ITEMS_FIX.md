# Personal Sales Portal Notification Fix

## Issue Identified
The personal sales portal notification was receiving an empty `verificationItems` array even when verified notes existed for submissions.

**Problem**: The original query was looking for verification items directly by `submission_id`:
```typescript
const { data: verificationItems, error: verificationError } = await supabase
  .from('verification_items')
  .select('*')
  .eq('submission_id', submissionId)  // ❌ WRONG - verification_items doesn't have submission_id
  .eq('is_verified', true);
```

## Root Cause
- `verification_items` table has `session_id`, not `submission_id`
- Verification items are linked through `verification_sessions` table
- The relationship is: `submission_id` → `verification_sessions` → `verification_items`

## Solution Implemented
Fixed the query to properly join through the verification session:

```typescript
// First, get the verification session
const { data: verificationSession } = await supabase
  .from('verification_sessions')
  .select('id')
  .eq('submission_id', submissionId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(1)
  .single();

let verificationItems: any[] = [];

if (verificationSession) {
  // Then get the verified items from that session
  const { data: items, error: verificationError } = await supabase
    .from('verification_items')
    .select('*')
    .eq('session_id', verificationSession.id)  // ✅ CORRECT - using session_id
    .eq('is_verified', true);

  if (!verificationError) {
    verificationItems = items || [];
    console.log(`Found ${verificationItems.length} verified items for submission ${submissionId}`);
  }
}
```

## Verification
For submission `6347392222496243200`:
- **Verification Session**: `58d8024e-57b4-4683-820e-cd66ae07387d`
- **Status**: `completed`
- **Total Items**: 33
- **Verified Items**: 14

## Expected Behavior
Now when a call result is saved with a licensed agent:
1. ✅ System finds the verification session for the submission
2. ✅ System fetches all verified verification items (14 items for this case)
3. ✅ Personal sales portal notification includes all verified client information
4. ✅ Message posts to correct licensed agent's Slack channel with complete data

## Files Modified
- `src/components/CallResultForm.tsx` - Fixed verification items query logic
- Build successful with no compilation errors
