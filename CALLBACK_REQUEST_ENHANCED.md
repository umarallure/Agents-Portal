# Callback Request Feature - Enhanced (Full Page View)

## Overview
Enhanced the callback request feature to display on a dedicated page with complete lead details instead of a popup dialog. Added a new edge function that sends rich Slack notifications with clickable buttons for agents to update call results directly.

## What Changed

### 1. New Callback Request Page
**File**: `src/pages/CallbackRequestPage.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Full-page layout** instead of modal dialog
- **Three-column responsive design**:
  - Left side (2/3 width): Complete lead information in organized cards
  - Right side (1/3 width): Sticky callback request form
- **Comprehensive lead details displayed**:
  - Customer Information: Name, Phone, State, Submission ID
  - Policy Information: Carrier, Coverage Amount, Monthly Premium, Lead Vendor
  - Timeline: Created Date, Submission Date (with time)
- **Enhanced UX**:
  - Back button to return to lead portal
  - Breadcrumb-style navigation
  - Professional card-based layout with icons
  - Sticky form that stays visible while scrolling
  - Loading states and proper error handling

**URL**: `/center-callback-request?submissionId=SUBMISSION_ID`

### 2. Updated Routing
**File**: `src/App.tsx`

Added new protected route for center users:
```typescript
<Route 
  path="/center-callback-request" 
  element={
    <CenterProtectedRoute>
      <CallbackRequestPage />
    </CenterProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

### 3. CenterLeadPortal Updates
**File**: `src/pages/CenterLeadPortal.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed dialog-based callback form
- Removed CallbackRequestForm import
- Removed state management for dialog (selectedLead, showCallbackForm)
- Updated "Send Callback" button to navigate to new page
- Cleaner, simpler component with navigation-based flow

**New Flow**:
```typescript
const handleSendCallback = (lead: Lead) => {
  navigate(`/center-callback-request?submissionId=${lead.submission_id}`);
};
```

### 4. New Edge Function for Slack Notifications
**File**: `supabase/functions/callback-notification/index.ts`

**Purpose**: Send rich, formatted Slack notifications to BPO center channels when callback requests are created.

**Features**:
- **Rich Slack Message Blocks** with professional formatting:
  - Header with emoji (ðŸ“ž Callback Request)
  - Structured fields layout showing all key information
  - Request type, customer details, carrier, state
  - Full notes section
  - Clickable action button
  - Context footer with submission ID

- **Clickable Button** that links to:
  ```
  https://agents-portal-uai.vercel.app/call-result-update?submissionId={SUBMISSION_ID}
  ```
  This allows agents to click directly from Slack to update the call result

- **Channel Routing**: Uses same lead vendor â†’ channel mapping as center-transfer-notification
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful error handling

**Slack Message Structure**:
```javascript
{
  blocks: [
    { type: 'header', text: 'ðŸ“ž Callback Request' },
    { 
      type: 'section', 
      fields: [
        'Request Type', 'Call Center',
        'Customer Name', 'Phone Number',
        'Carrier', 'State'
      ]
    },
    { type: 'section', text: 'Notes: ...' },
    { type: 'divider' },
    {
      type: 'actions',
      elements: [{
        type: 'button',
        text: 'ðŸ“‹ Update Call Result',
        url: 'https://...',
        style: 'primary'
      }]
    },
    { type: 'context', elements: ['Submission ID: ...'] }
  ]
}
```

âœ… **More Information**: Can show complete lead details without cramping
âœ… **Cleaner Navigation**: Browser back button works naturally
âœ… **Bookmarkable**: Direct URL for callback requests
âœ… **Better Focus**: Dedicated page reduces cognitive load

### Technical Improvements
âœ… **Simpler State Management**: No dialog state to manage
âœ… **Better Accessibility**: Full page navigation is more accessible
âœ… **Easier Testing**: Can navigate directly to page for testing
âœ… **Better SEO**: Proper page routing vs hidden modal

### Slack Integration Improvements
âœ… **Professional Formatting**: Rich blocks with proper layout

## Technical Details

### Request Type Options
1. **New Application** (`new_application`)
2. **Updating Billing/Draft Date** (`updating_billing`)
3. **Fulfilling Pending Carrier Requirements** (`carrier_requirements`)

### Database Schema
Table: `callback_requests`
- Stores all callback request data
- Status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed)
- Audit trail with timestamps
- RLS policies for security

### Security
- **Protected Route**: Only center users can access callback request page
- **Vendor Filtering**: Users only see leads from their own vendor
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security on callback_requests table
- **Auth Required**: Must be authenticated to submit requests

### API Endpoints
1. **Database**: Standard Supabase client operations
2. **Edge Function**: `callback-notification` for Slack integration
   - Method: POST
   - Invoked after successful database insert
   - Sends notification to appropriate channel

supabase functions list
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is configured in Supabase Edge Functions secrets:
```bash
supabase secrets set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token-here
```

### Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel (automatic if connected to repo)
# Or manual deployment:
vercel --prod
```

## URL Structure

### Development
- Callback Request Page: `http://localhost:8080/center-callback-request?submissionId=SUBMISSION_ID`
- Call Result Update: `http://localhost:8080/call-result-update?submissionId=SUBMISSION_ID`

### Production
- Callback Request Page: `https://agents-portal-uai.vercel.app/center-callback-request?submissionId=SUBMISSION_ID`
