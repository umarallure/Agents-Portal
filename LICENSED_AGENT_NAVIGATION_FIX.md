# Licensed Agent Navigation Access Fix

## Issue
Licensed agent user Lydia (lydia.s@unlimitedinsurance.io, user_id: d68d18e4-9deb-4282-b4d0-1e6e6a0789e9) was unable to:
1. See the navigation menu
2. Access the Commission Portal

Even though she had a valid `agent_status` record with `agent_type = 'licensed'`.

## Root Cause
The `NavigationHeader` component had a hardcoded list of "authorized users" that controlled navigation menu visibility. Licensed agents who were not in this hardcoded list could not see any navigation menu, preventing them from accessing the Commission Portal.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `NavigationHeader.tsx`
- **Added logic to show navigation for licensed agents**: Created a new variable `shouldShowNavigation` that displays the menu for either:
  - Authorized users (hardcoded list) with navigation access, OR
  - Licensed agents (detected via `useLicensedAgent` hook)

- **Reorganized navigation menu sections**:
  - **Lead Management section**: Only visible to authorized users (existing behavior)
  - **Licensed Agent section**: New section showing Commission Portal - visible to ALL licensed agents
  - **Reports & Analytics section**: Only visible to authorized users (existing behavior)
  - **Tools section**: Only visible to authorized users (existing behavior)

### 2. Updated `CommissionPortal.tsx`
- Replaced custom header with `NavigationHeader` component for consistency
- Removed duplicate sign-out functionality (now handled by NavigationHeader)
- Fixed pagination syntax error (`})()()}` â†’ `})()`)
- Moved display name badge below header for cleaner layout

### 3. Previously Fixed `ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- Added licensed agent detection via `useLicensedAgent` hook
- Skip center user check for licensed agents to prevent RLS 406 errors
- This ensures licensed agents don't trigger unnecessary database queries

## Benefits
1. **Scalable**: Any user with `agent_type = 'licensed'` in `agent_status` table automatically gets navigation access
2. **No hardcoding**: No need to add user IDs to hardcoded lists
3. **Secure**: Licensed agents only see the Commission Portal menu item, not all navigation options
4. **Consistent**: Commission Portal now uses the same NavigationHeader as other pages
5. **RLS-safe**: No more 406 errors from querying restricted tables

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Licensed agents can see navigation menu with Commission Portal option
- [ ] Licensed agents can access `/commission-portal` route
- [ ] Licensed agents do NOT see unauthorized sections (Lead Management, Reports, Tools)
- [ ] Regular authorized users still see all navigation sections
- [ ] Center users are redirected properly
- [ ] Restricted users are redirected properly
- [ ] No RLS 406 errors in console

## Database Verification
```sql
-- Verify Lydia's agent status
SELECT * FROM agent_status WHERE user_id = 'd68d18e4-9deb-4282-b4d0-1e6e6a0789e9';
-- Should show: agent_type = 'licensed'

-- Verify Lydia's profile
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE user_id = 'd68d18e4-9deb-4282-b4d0-1e6e6a0789e9';
-- Should show: display_name = 'Lydia'

-- Get Lydia's pending commission leads
SELECT * FROM daily_deal_flow 
WHERE licensed_agent_account = 'Lydia' 
AND status = 'Pending Approval';
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/NavigationHeader.tsx` - Added licensed agent navigation logic
2. `src/pages/CommissionPortal.tsx` - Replaced custom header with NavigationHeader
3. `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Skip center check for licensed agents (already done)

## How to Add More Licensed Agents
Simply insert a record in the `agent_status` table:
```sql
INSERT INTO agent_status (user_id, status, agent_type)
VALUES ('new-user-id', 'available', 'licensed');
```

No code changes needed!
